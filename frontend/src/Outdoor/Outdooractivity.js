                            Let them play on their own and create fun activities to engage their little brains.For many kids, this means being stuck indoors, as parents try to juggle school work, telework, and running a household, while managing any underlying pandemic stress. Reports of expensive bylaw tickets being issued for gathering in parks, 
                            or even playing in green spaces, are also a barrier to outdoor play.But experts say that it is critical for children to stay active, maintain a routine or set a schedule, and try to get outside as much as possible. Getting outdoors has both physical and mental health benefits, including increasing physical-activity levels, boosting mood, preventing anxiety, and contributing to a healthy immune system.

                            If you don’t have any areas that you can go to collect rocks, you may have to go collect your rocks a home improvement or a landscaping store that carries smooth round unfinished river stones in bulk.

                              With a little advanced planning, send your kids on a treasure hunt. Start with a homemade map you’ve stained with coffee and scorched the edges.
                                                         Have some prizes at the end of their adventure.The treasure hunt is especially fun with school-age kids who can read the clues themselves, though they may occasionally need help. With a lot of grandchildren on hand, the treasure hunt is likely to turn into a mad dash. With a single grandchild, it will be more leisurely.
                                                         With multiple grandchildren, you'll want to make them take turns reading the clues and be sure to provide enough "treasure" for each child at the end.

                              This is such a simple activity for kids and it’s SO fun. You will need multiple hula hoops. Head to an area with lots of green space, and have the children line up. Holding the hula hoops vertically, roll them with as much force as you can along the ground. Call out each child’s name and have them run after the hoop to catch it. Every time they bring back a hoop, throw another one! This is amazing hand-eye coordination practice.
