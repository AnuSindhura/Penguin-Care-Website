                   Whether your company has required that you work from home for a few weeks or your children's schools are closed, the 
                   coronavirus outbreak means a lot more of time spent indoors. Of course, your kids' health and safety is paramount, but 
                   keeping your little ones entertained for hours on end is probably vital for your sanity. In an effort to make the next few

                                 are perfect the smallest rock hunters.  Grab some paints, a handful of rocks, and your little ones and let’s start stone painting!</p>

                             <p>My little kids have a new favorite activity: fingerprint art. They have spent hours in the past few weeks making finger and thumb prints and 
                                 then adding details with a black Sharpie to turn the prints into all sorts of animals, monsters, bugs, etc. It’s a fantastic boredom buster: it keeps them busy and quiet without
                                  the aid of electronics or any help from me.
                                  And as long as we have wipes handy for them to clean up with, it doesn’t even make a mess.</p>

                                  matchbox cars. Think outside the box and have the track scale furniture and other obstacles (just make sure it’s something 
                                  you don’t mind toy vehicles being “driven” over). The key to making it active is to make it large-scale, so they are engaging their core muscles while crawling all over.</p>
